## Coinex Research  
I probably read every single thing on the interenet that contains the word Coinex. It has been used in alledged scams involving coins of some sort since the mid 1980's it seems. 

## Poland Connection  
After much reading I found a [newspaper article](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-10-31-fi-13568-story.html) dated Oct. 31, 1985. Here I find a similar story but with different people. The name coinex has been used with fraud many times it seems.   
  
The original company was ran by a man named [Edward Mazure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Mazur). He was a businessman from poland who went to school in Chicago. Mazur was accused by Poland's prosecutors of contracting, in 1998, the murder of Polish National Police chief, [General Marek Papała](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marek_Papa%C5%82a). In 2007 the [US Government refuses to extradite him](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna19875743) to poland.  In August 2014, the Polish prosecution dropped their case against Mazur. After a lengthy prosecution, they cited lack of evidence against him to conclude that he committed the crime. The Papała contract killing is widely regarded[according to whom?] as the most serious unsolved crime involving former communist security services SB, high-ranking members of the government, and the mafia, since Poland's transition to democracy in 1989. The US government refused to allow extradition.

## ViaBTC
ViaBTC is a global cryptocurrency mining pool and platform, but its corporate headquarters are located in
Shenzhen, Guangdong, China, within the Nanshan District, at the Tianxia International Center. This is the parent company of coinex as far as I am aware. The CEO of coinex is [Haipo Yang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haipo-yang-83518563) he has had many problems in china supposedly even being arrested with his whole family. Now I wonder why would people in China be using this name? 

## Theory / Opinion
One more interesting fact is that [AlphaBay got shut down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaBay) in July 2017 following a major international law enforcement operation codenamed "Operation Bayonet". CoinEx was founded in December 2017 by Haipo Yang, an early Bitcoin investor, and is a professional cryptocurrency exchange that grew out of the ViaBTC ecosystem. Moore interesting coincidence would be Binance was founded in July of 2017. Kucoin was founded September 2017. Alameda Research was founded in September 2017. BitMart was founded in 2017 by Sheldon Xia, officially launching its global cryptocurrency exchange platform in 2018. OKX, which was formerly known as OKEx, was founded by Star Xu in 2017. The parent company, OK Group, was established earlier in 2013 (the [silk road was busted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)) in late 2013). 

I wonder where they got all the coins to start?
