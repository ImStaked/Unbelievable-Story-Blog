excerpt: "I worked with these people from Romania. I was unaware at the time but it would have been best to just find something else to work on. They still owe me between 50k and 100k."

## The People  

- **Flavian Manea (CEO)** - Military Technical Academy "Ferdinand I"  
[Here is someone](https://www.linkedin.com/in/flavian-manea) with the same name, same country, who went to school in london, but different picture doing medical application development.

- **Alexandru Minulescu (CTO)** - Politehnica University of Bucharest

- **Matei Popp** - Politehnica University of Bucharest

- **Radu Enoiu** - The Military Technical Academy, Bucharest

- **Alexandru Catalin Filip** - His linkdin says University of Cambridge. The wall street journall says he received his MBA from the University of Warwick. Which is true?   

Alexandru is also the Deputy General Director at [Aerostar SA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerostar_(Romanian_company)). Aerostar SA, a major Romanian aerospace and defense manufacturer, is heavily involved in supporting Ukraine through defense cooperation, including training pilots and potentially supplying military hardware, with official agreements for security cooperation and enhanced air force coordination, building on existing use of Romanian defense products by Ukraine's forces
.
## What is this  
It looks like we have 2 graduates of military school and a couple of technical people and a guy who is funneling all of this money into their defence contractor company in order to support the war in Ukraine. Some of them look like they are from london which is possibly true.   
   
I can say that [Alchemy bought bware labs](https://www.alchemy.com/blog/alchemy-acquires-bware-labs) for an undisclosed sum of money. Reid Hoffman was an angel investor in Alchemy. The founders of Alchemy are [Nikil Viswanathan (CEO)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikilster) and [Joe Lau (CTO)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephlau) both went to Stanford University.
