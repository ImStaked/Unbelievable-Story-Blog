title: "Bware Labs Blast API"
excerpt: "I helped with these people from Romania with their 'Houston' testnet starting in August of 2022. I was unaware at the time but it would have been best to just find something else to work on. They never paid me the large amount of tokens I was owed. It turns out one of them work for a Romanian Defense contractor. I did not agree to donate my money to the Ukraine war"

## Bware Labs Problems
First, guess who hooked me up with this project? Pathrock aka [Patrick Hofmeister](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-hofmeister-0433b0166?originalSubdomain=de)

Second, with so many military and Romania government people and the war in Ukraine combined with the DOJ case that includes someone with an almost identical name as Alexandru Catalin Filip. Given the connection to Aerostar SA which also has some sort of connection to South Dakota I would guess that somehow this is connected to financing the war in Ukraine. 

Third, around or near this time Hunter Biden was in the news connected to some influence peddling. 

Why they would refuse to pay me? I don't know. 

Likely it is so classified they felt they could get away with it.  

## People involved

- **Flavian Manea (CEO)** - Military Technical Academy "Ferdinand I"  
[Here is someone](https://www.linkedin.com/in/flavian-manea) with the same name, same country, who went to school in london, but different picture doing medical application development.

- **Alexandru Minulescu (CTO)** - Politehnica University of Bucharest

- **Matei Popp** - Politehnica University of Bucharest

- **Radu Enoiu** - The Military Technical Academy, Bucharest

- **Alexandru Catalin Filip** - His linkdin says University of Cambridge. The wall street journall says he received his MBA from the University of Warwick. Which is true?   

Alexandru is also the Deputy General Director at [Aerostar SA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerostar_(Romanian_company)). Aerostar SA, a major Romanian aerospace and defense manufacturer, is heavily involved in supporting Ukraine through defense cooperation, including training pilots and potentially supplying military hardware, with official agreements for security cooperation and enhanced air force coordination, building on existing use of Romanian defense products by Ukraine's forces.

[DOJ Case](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/man-sentenced-integral-role-sophisticated-international-fraud-scheme)   
   
## What is this  
I think the DOJ case explains what it was pretty well. Now why would a San Fransisco company (Alchemy) purchase the useless business that was basically subject of a fraud investigation?
   
I can say that [Alchemy bought bware labs](https://www.alchemy.com/blog/alchemy-acquires-bware-labs) for an undisclosed sum of money. Reid Hoffman was an angel investor in Alchemy. The founders of Alchemy are [Nikil Viswanathan (CEO)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikilster) and [Joe Lau (CTO)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephlau) both went to Stanford University.
