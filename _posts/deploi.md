excerpt: "The company focuses on decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenization, private credit, and other aspects of Web3 and digital assets. I was helping them run a node on Canton Network and was helping get their developer up to speed. In return they wasted 2 months of my time while delaying my payment until I turned off their services"

## Deploi
The founders of the Swedish blockchain company deploi are Oskars Jepsis and Oleksandr Zeziulinskyi.    

[Oskars Jepsis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oskarjepsen/) is based out of Latvia, Europe and is the Acting-Representative of BonusBlock. Oskars previously worked at Mintos as a Onboarding Team Lead.  
  
[Oleksandr Zeziulinskyi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oleksandr-zeziulinskyi/) is the CTO and co-founder of deploi. He is actually from Ukraine if you look really hard.

Deploi is supposedly based in Stockholm, Sweden but they operate a lot like the FBI people I have ran across especially in how they use weird names. The company focuses on decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenization, private credit, and other aspects of Web3 and digital assets. 

Pathrock aka [Patrick Hofmeister](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-hofmeister-0433b0166?originalSubdomain=de) hooked me up with these people.

## Problems
These people just wasted my time. There was a guy named Paul who was suppsoed to be a developer there but I think it was the guy from Ukraine using the name of someone I used to know. I worked for 3 weeks then when I started asking about money first the Deploi people and Pathrock kept pointing at each other for who was supposed to pay me. It seemed they were paying Pathrock but not me. 

When I started bugging them about money they interviewed me for a blockchain engineer job and for whatever reason never provided a clear answer on that. I did find out later they hired two guys from Vietnam to do what I was doing.

After a bit more time about 50 days total I sent both Pathrock and Deploi an invoice, shut off their computers, and contacted the person from the linux foundation that was sponsoring the deploi people threatening to embarras them and finally my invoices were paid.
