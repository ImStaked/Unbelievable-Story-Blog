## The Hack
I was invited to participate in the Mina Protocol Adversarial Test Network in late 2020. My goal was to win. In my mind I thought whoever ended up with the most tokens would be the winner. Since it was an Adversarial network I took that to mean "A Hostile environment meant to test the security of the network". So I got my machine all set up and working then went to the chat room to provide technical support to other users. This is when I realized everyone had the same password to their private keys. I thought if I could get the keys I would basically win. So I got the URL where I was instructed to get my key and removed the file name. I was present with a directory of all private keys. I quickly wrote a bash script to extract all of them from the file server then ran it. Once all of the keys were on my laptop I them moved coins from 4 different wallets into my wallet to prove I could do it with any wallet. I contacted the people who took over 12 hours to respond. After much arguing and back and forth during which I likely used profanity with Evan Shapiro and he used that as an excuse to kick me out of their "Community".
