## The Hack
I was invited to participate in the Mina Protocol Adversarial Test Network in late 2020. My goal was to win. In my mind I thought whoever ended up with the most tokens would be the winner. Since it was an Adversarial network I took that to mean "A Hostile environment meant to test the security of the network". So I got my machine all set up and working then went to the chat room to provide technical support to other users. This is when I realized everyone had the same password to their private keys. I thought if I could get the keys I would basically win. So I got the URL where I was instructed to get my key and removed the file name. I was present with a directory of all private keys. I quickly wrote a bash script to extract all of them from the file server then ran it. Once all of the keys were on my laptop I them moved coins from 4 different wallets into my wallet to prove I could do it with any wallet. I contacted the people who took over 12 hours to respond. After much arguing and back and forth during which I likely used profanity with Evan Shapiro and he used that as an excuse to kick me out of their "Community". 

Like everything else in my life they refused to give me credit for my work, refused to classify the issue as critical, and finally did pay me 66,000 tokens but shorted me 4,000$ in cash. Here is their [Testnet Retrospective](https://minaprotocol.com/blog/adversarial-testnet-retrospective-testworld)

## Mina Protocol People

- **Evan Shaprio (CEO)** - Carnegie Mellon University (2011-2015)  
In 2014 researchers at Carnegie Mellon University's (CMU) Software Engineering Institute (SEI) developed a technique to de-anonymize users of the Tor network, and this data was subsequently used by law enforcement. The SEI is a U.S. Department of Defense federally funded research and development center (FFRDC) based at Carnegie Mellon. Looks suspect to me but I'm paranoid from people trying to kill me for 5 years.  

- **Izaak Meckler (CTO)** -  
I heard he is promoting socialism stuff in california now. I don't have a problem with him.
  
## Mina Foundation
2023-12-19 Mina Foundation has completed a move to Switzerland. This would have been after I started publishing info about the Nadi family and how they are connected. I was forced to remove everything from X several times. What is now on my X account is just the latest time. I have published the data lots of times.  

- **Malalai Nadi** - President Mina Foundation   
My research suggests she came to the USA in the mid 80's after her or her family helped with the Russians in Afganastan making them possibly connected to the CIA. If I am wrong I would be happy to correct this.  
  
- **Urzala Weiss** -  Weiss Asset Management (WAM) Foundation  
  
- **Ahmad Nadi** - Malalai's husband? Within 10 years of arriving in the USA Ahmed gets setup by the FBI for fraud on a DOD contract for salt and pepper --> [FRAUD CASE](https://case-law.vlex.com/vid/u-s-v-nadi-884510525)   
  
- **Dawer Nadi** - Perhaps Ahmed's brother? Prosecuted by Latisha James the NYAG who was going after crypto. Weird she didn't bother the Mina project based in the USA. Dawer on his first fraud case fled to Afganastan.  
Fraud cases --> [FRAUD CASE 1](https://www.casemine.com/judgement/us/59146903add7b049342cfa6f) [FRAUD CASE 2](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-announces-conviction-former-fugitive-dentist-medicaid)

## Opinion
Fraud seems to be a trend here. It appears that there is a level of corruption or influence or Rackettering being excerted here that might go above and beyond normal. What is that RICO thing for? I have suspected this was an FBI / CIA project from the start so if that is true the I have hacked the feds.
