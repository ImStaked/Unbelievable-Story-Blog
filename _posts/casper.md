excerpt: "This is how I got close to the people from Casper Labs, helped them by contributing work and resources, and how I found all of the information about them. They owed me 377,000 tokens which at the time would have brought me near 50,000$ over time. Now the token is virtually worthless"

## Casper Labs   
I want to start by saying that "I AM NOT ACCUSING THEM OF MONEY LAUNDERING" but it kinda does look like fraud and money laundering. I am just about 100% certain they were running a government operation. This is evidenced by the people around them going to jail / getting sued and they just walk away leaving a giant mess behind. They are now working with former USAF people and IBM. Those people are either helping the government or they are now in danger these people are like the wrecking crew. The go around causing all kinds of problems and maybe they were moving money for the Epstein people or someone in Massachussets.  
  
I started working with them to help with the Zugg 500 test network. Zugg, Switzerland seems to be where alot of the money either went or came from. They had me submit a resume and everything. It turns out they didn't want to hire me after they found out who I was. That didn't prevent them from working with me. They were supposed to pay me 377,000 CSPR tokens when mainnet was started but I was never paid.  

Casper labs had an office located in [Cambridge, Massachusetts](https://www.zoominfo.com/c/casperlabs/464535978). After some research I found that the building is connected to the Oxford Group. The oxford people are a whole other issue that I wont get into here. Then I find they are in Puerto Rico and Switzerland also. What does a business with 10 people working for it need companies located in multiple countries for? Also since they started in Massachusetts we can be almost certain Elizebeth Warren was helping them.  

They received money from [Terren Peizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terren_Peizer) who is now in jail on the first of its kind case from the SEC. You can read about it here.

They also likely received money from [Brock Pierce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Pierce) who probably at minimum knew Epstein.

## China Connection
Medha had me work with a guy from [Waterdrip Capitol](https://waterdrip.io/) which is a VC firm from China. I suspect she and Mrinal are FBI or CIA so why was she working with money people from China? They had me train the best friend of the founder of Waterdrip Capitol. Waterdrip Capital was founded in 2017 by the most forward-thinking Chinese blockchain pioneers. Yushan Zheng Founder, Jademont Zheng Co-founder, Peicai Li Founder, Jialing Liu Founder.

## World Economic Forum 
When Casper Labs was in Davos I started publishing information about all of them basically calling them out for being scammers in front of the whole world. They were partnering with IBM but it looks like I messed that up for them. Now they launched ProveAi which is on Hedera. Hedera was founded by 2 guys in the Dallas area where I am from and coincidentally is where JFK was shot. These are the types of enemies I have made.

## Hedera
Leemon Baird and Mance Harmon founded Hedera. Leemon Baird is a strange name and I used to know another guy I suspected of being an informant named Baird which makes me think fake name, He graduated from Carnegie Mellon University where Mrinal claims to have went to school. Leemon has worked in the United States Air Force Academy Academy Center for Cyberspace Research and Security and in the USAF doing education. Mance Harmon was a Research Scientist for Machine Learning (Artificial Intelligence) Air Force Research Laboratory: Wright Laboratory. Mance went to school at University of Massachusetts Amherst.

## Shell Companies   
Adaptive Holding Ltd. appears to be a Cayman Islands-based entity linked to the blockchain company CasperLabs, acting as a parent/holding company that transitioned its structure, with CasperLabs Holdings AG becoming the top entity for its group, sharing officers and resources across entities like CasperLabs LLC (US) and the original Adaptive Holdings Ltd., according to legal filings. While its direct business isn't detailed in these snippets, it functions as part of a larger, interconnected tech/crypto corporate structure.

Casper Labs (now largely rebranded as Prove AI) had a corporate office listed in [Cambridge, Massachusetts](https://www.datanyze.com/companies/casperlabs/464535978).
