## Subquery  
I started out helping [Pathrock](https://pathrocknetwork.org/) (Patrick Hofmeister) when the network was the pre-mainnet test network Kepler. Fun fact... If you break down the name Hof meister in German means Court master. I think it is a fake name but he supposedly works for the railroad in Germany called [Deutsche Bahn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-hofmeister-0433b0166). He is the one who set me up to work with many of the prior blockchains on this blog.  

When I was working on Near Protocol one of the other people there told me I should try working with Pathrock and that person was called [Blaze aka Henry Tafolla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrytafolla/) It turns out all of them seem to be working on projects that in some way end up financially supporting the war in Ukraine.

SubQuery (SubQuery Network) is a New Zealand-based Web3 data infrastructure company that
provides a universal data indexing framework, allowing developers to easily organize, query, and access data from various blockchains (like Polkadot, Cosmos, Ethereum) for building decentralized applications (dApps), acting as a fast, flexible "data-as-a-service" layer to make blockchain data more accessible and useful for builders

## OnFinality
The network was founded by Sam Zou and Ian He who also founded the company OnFinality from New Zealand. They look like they are affiliated with China in some way. I only lost about 2,000$ on this project. The project was never designed to be successful. The price has only went down the whole time it has existed. OnFinality, a New Zealand-based company, provides essential blockchain infrastructure services (like scalable APIs and dedicated nodes) and developer tools that help web3 builders easily deploy, run, and scale decentralized applications (dApps) across networks like Polkadot, Cosmos, and Ethereum, essentially making blockchain development faster and less complex. 

I wonder if they are using the services from the providers on the subquery network to provide business services to the onfinality customer base? While at the same time paying the providers with virtually useless tokens that loose more value every single day?
