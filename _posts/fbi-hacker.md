excerpt: "The FBI and the goverment set me up to look like an informant then let everyone try to kill me while protecting the names of my family members. Dead people don't talk. Here is a collection of all of the federal cases connected to something I have worked on or someone I have known."

I did not ever work with the Feds on purpose. If they have told anyone anything that is different they are lying. I suspect everyone now knows that I did not agree to work with the Feds despite how they act like I am their little hacker boy that they dont have to pay. 

Why would the feds change my whole families information on the internet without ever giving me a new name? I looked myself up and found these are my relatives? I only know one of these names and that person has been dead a long tme.  
```Laura Tate, 76  Mark Cox, 53  Cheryl Cox, 78  Monica Eastridge, 47  Kellie Hecht, 70  Margaret Rickord, 93```  
  
Obviously someone feels what I do is dangerous for those around me. Yet nobody will give me a new name, pay me, give me paying work, talk to me, or help in any way. I think this is because they have been trying to get me killed while at the same time trying to maintain plausible deniability.

How is it possible for this many fed cases to happen to people all around me? Not only that, I 'accidentially' got hooked up with people connected to Epstein, what looks like money laundering for Ukraine, and I keep finding what looks like CIA and Pentagon type operations. This is all just an accident right? Who believes that? 

I have not even posted the stuff about the FBI guy Tyler Ludwig from Texarkana or is in Indiana and January 6th. Nor have I posted the information about Johnny Sharp Jr. and Arlene Gaylord both of which retired right after Trump became president.

I also have a notebook full of information that leads back to Bill Clinton which the feds stole out of my hotel room and copied now they are in a spot because they wont come speak to me but have been using all of the data I collect.
