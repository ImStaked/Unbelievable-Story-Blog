I did not ever work with the Feds on purpose. If they have told anyone anything that is different they are lying. I suspect everyone now knows that I did not agree to work with the Feds despite how they act like I am their little hacker boy that they dont have to pay. They literally use me to collect information then steal it out of my hotel room then use it to put people in jail the whole time never paying me anything. 

Why would the feds change my whole families information on the internet without? I looked myself up and compiled this list of relatives? I only know 3 of these names never heard of the rest. That is only 18.75% accurate weird.  
```Laura Tate, 76  Mark Cox, 53  Cheryl Cox, 78  Monica Eastridge, 47  Kellie Hecht, 70  Margaret Rickord, 93 Toni Willis, Gregory Willis, Nancy Perrine, Ana Barbosa, Stuart Rice, Diane Washington, Keith Worsham, Louise Smith, Julienne Gore, Kevin Oman``` 
   
Coincidence? My Uncle in Carrollton Texas is named [Greg Willis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/willis-greg-64a8a56b). The [Colin County Texas District Attorney is named Greg Willis](https://ballotpedia.org/Greg_Willis). Now it is easier to see which names are real right? I know the FBI and CIA both do things like this to confuse people. See the FBI Agent below with the same name as a hockey player. I have lots more examples, but most are informants not public figures, I get headaches if I post their info everywhere.  
  
Obviously someone feels what I do is dangerous for those around me. Yet nobody will give me a new name, pay me, give me paying work, talk to me, or help in any way. I think this is because they have been trying to get me killed while at the same time trying to maintain plausible deniability.

How is it possible for this many fed cases to happen to people all around me? Not only that, I 'accidentially' got hooked up with people connected to Epstein, what looks like money laundering for Ukraine, and I keep finding what looks like CIA and Pentagon type operations. This is all just an accident right? Who believes that? 

I also have a notebook full of information that leads back to Bill Clinton which the feds stole out of my hotel room and copied now they are in a spot because they wont come speak to me but have been using all of the data I collect.  

## CIA?
This is from one of my court case documents. It looks like it says CIA to me. Why?

## FBI Agent Tyler Ludwig  
First this is likely a stage name. Tyler Ludwig is also a hockey player from Dallas.    
Second I suspect he was involved with Amy's arrest.  
I think him and his friends on various task forces worked to get me killed.

## FBI Johnny Sharp Jr.  
Notice how he retired once Biden was out. I can't prove he was involved in what happened to me, but I heard he was incharge of the crypto subversion stuff for the FBI in some ways.

## FBI Arlene Gaylord
Notice how she retired once Biden was out. I can only say she had a strong negatve reaction to the words "God Damn", plus she is from Puerto Rico. Later I found out her husband is a preacher.
